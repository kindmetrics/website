Kindmetrics is open source since yesterday. What does that mean for you? I will tell you below.

You can check the code by yourself to be sure that will handle the data from your visitors in a good way. If you are not technical you can trmet that others that are will check and approve or disapproved the code.

You can also help push Kindmetrics forward in maybe the road you want Kindmetrics to take. You can get things done faster.

And most important, an total transparent follow of a project you will like. You can see what changes we do and when we did them. All those bugs we fixed and also those we created. It can't be more transparent than this.

You can also deploy your own server of kindmetrics and won't need to pay me or letting me host your data. It will be safest for you that way and some would like that way more than paying me, And I am okay with that.
