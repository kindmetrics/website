Kindmetrics is out as a paid version. No more beta version or test cases. We are not open in the full version, where people have to pay to use it.

The release of the paid version is a significant milestone for Kindmetrics and myself. Since May, I have been working with this stage, and it is a significant milestone for me.

The next steps from here are many new features, bug fixes, and more content for the landing page. I plan to add new features and integrations and then write some comparing pages to compare Kindmetrics against similar analytics tools.

I hope you are happy with Kindmetrics and would join this journey with me.
