Kindmetrics is out in open beta!

I wanted to say that for 20 days now. That's right; I have been working on Kindmetrics for 20 days. With that, I have been pushing commits almost every day. It has been challenging, but I am happy to have it in open beta finally.

I got inspired by *Simple analytics*, *Fathom*, *Piwik/Matomo*, and *Plausible*. I tried to put everything I felt was fair and optimized the privacy even more than they did. I think that it is crucial to know. They are based on un-EU countries; they use the third party that is either bad on privacy or in America that is not so good. Kindmetrics is EU-based, has servers on EU soil (Germany), and only uses EU-based third parties, like Mailjet.

So Kindmetrics is stepping up the game! I hope you will like the service.

So what can I do on Kindmetrics now?

You can do:
* See total uniques, total page views, and bounce rate
* most visited Pages
* top referrers
* top countries
* top devices, browser, and OS.
* Detailed referrer with links to a page that links to you
* Detailed country page with a giant map of the world, with marked countries that have visited you.

You will be using all the above right now. And for now, it is free. The only thing I am asking as a return is feedback and bug reports. In that way, we can move forward and do the following in my current todo:

What you can do soon:
* Email reports to custom emails and yourself
* Own domain for the javascript file
* And more to come
* pay for Kindmetrics

Feel free to come with ideas for making Kindmetrics even better!

I hope you will enjoy Kindmetrics as much as I did, making it.
