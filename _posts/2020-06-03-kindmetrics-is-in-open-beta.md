Kindmetrics is out in open beta!

Wanted to say that for 20 days now. That's right, I have been working on kindmetrics for 20 days. With that I have been pushing commits almost every day. It have been hard but I am happy to finally have it in open beta.

I got inspired by *Simple analytics*, *Fathom*, *Piwik/Matomo* and *Plausible*. I tried to put everything I felt was good and optimized the privacy even more than they did. I think that is important to know. They are based on un-EU countries, they use third party that are either bad on privacy or in America that is not so good on privacy. Kindmetrics is EU-based, have the servers on EU soil (Germany) and only use eu-based third parties, like Mailjet.

So Kindmetrics is stepping up the game! I hope you will like the service.

So what can I do on Kindmetrics now?

You can do:
* See total uniques, total page views and bounce rate
* most visited Pages
* top referrers
* top countries
* top devices, browser and OS.
* Detailed referrer with links to page that links to you
* Detailed country page with big map of the world, with marked countries that have visited you.

You will be using all above right now. And for now it is free. Only thing I am asking as a return is feedback and bug reports. In that way we can move forward and do following in my current todo:

What you can do soon:
* Email reports to custom emails and yourself
* Own domain for the javascript file
* And more to come
* pay for Kindmetrics

Feel free to come with ideas for making Kindmetrics even better!

I hope you will enjoy Kindmetrics as much as I did making it.
