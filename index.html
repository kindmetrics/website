    <h3 class="mb-2">Kind</h3>
    <p class="leading-6 text-gray-700">Kindmetrics is built on being kind to you and your visitor`s privacy and data. There will still be accurate data, and it will show you all you need to do the best work possible.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="mb-2">Simplicity</h3>
    <p class="leading-6 text-gray-700">Kindmetrics is as kind to you as it is to your visitors. It is simple to set up.

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="mb-2">Lightweight script</h3>
    <p class="leading-6 text-gray-700">The Kindmetrics script is tiny, around 40 times smaller than Google Analytics. It lets your visitors use less bandwidth when visiting your website.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="mb-2">Share your analytics</h3>
    <p class="leading-6 text-gray-700">Share your analytics privately or publicly with friends and clients. They will see the same dashboard you use, which will be easily sharable through a unique URL.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 class="mb-2">Open-source project</h3>
    <p class="leading-6 text-gray-700">Kindmetrics is open source, so you can check the code yourself and analyze whether it is handling your data correctly, as well as contribute and push the project forward with things you may want or need, or even host the service yourself.

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-black">Can I use Kindmetrics on multiple sites?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can add as many sites as you like. All the sites' page views will be counted together toward the monthly page-view allotment of your price plan.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-black">How can I start tracking?</h3>
    <p>It's easy! Just add a javascript to your HTML header. Wordpress, Ghost, and Squarespace, for instance, can easily accommodate it in their systems. Later, documentation will be added for those. Read more about how to add <a href="https://docs.kindmetrics.io/#getting-started">your tracking code here.</a></p>

  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-black">Will you block me if I reach the limit?</h3>
    <p>No, we are kind! We won't block you or charge for traffic spikes. If you reach the limit two months in a row, we will contact you, and you can then decide if you want to upgrade or cancel your account. You will have two weeks to decide. No hard feelings at all.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-black">Why isn't Kindmetrics free?</h3>
    <p>At Kindmetrics, we are only selling a product. We won't sell your data or personal information. You pay a small fee for getting to own your own data, which we think is fair. Google Analytics is free, but you are paying them with your data instead.</p>
