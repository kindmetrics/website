  <h2 id="faq" class="leading-6 text-gray-800 text-3xl mb-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-gray-800 text-2xl">Can I use Kindmetrics on multiple sites?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can add as many sites as you like. All the sites' page views will be counted together toward your price plan's monthly page-view allotment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-gray-800 text-2xl">How can I start tracking?</h3>
    <p>It's easy! Just add a javascript to your HTML header. WordPress, Ghost, and Squarespace, for instance, can easily accommodate it in their systems. Later, documentation will be added for those. Read more about how to add <a href="https://docs.kindmetrics.io/#getting-started">your tracking code here.</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-gray-800 text-2xl">Will you block me if I reach the limit?</h3>
    <p>No, we are kind! We won't block you or charge for traffic spikes. If you reach the limit two months in a row, we will contact you, and you can then decide if you want to upgrade or cancel your account. You will have two weeks to decide.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="mb-2 leading-6 text-gray-800 text-2xl">Why isn't Kindmetrics free?</h3>
    <p>At Kindmetrics, we are only selling a product. We won't sell your data or personal information. You pay a small fee for getting to own your data, which we think is fair. Google Analytics is free, but you are paying them with your data instead.</p>
