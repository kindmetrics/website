  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-black">Will you block me if I reach the limit?</h3>
    <p>No, we are kind! We won't block or charge for traffic spikes. If you reach over the limit two months in a row we will contact you and you can then decide if you want to upgrade or cancel your account. You will have 2 weeks. No hard feelings at all.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="my-6 w-full text-gray-700">
    <h3 class="text-black">Why isn't Kindmetrics free?</h3>
    <p>At Kindmetrics we are only selling a product. We won't sell your data or personal information. Our business model is selling an service, not data.</p>
    <p>You pay an small fee for still owning your own data. Which we think is fair.</p>
